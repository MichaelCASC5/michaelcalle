				<p>As you might already be able to tell, my name is Michael Calle. I was born in Queens, New York, in December of 2002. At a young age I discovered my urge to want to build things, and create things, but I always found myself limited in terms of resources and ability. When I was in middle school, I took a free introduction to computer science and programming course with the Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics (BEAM), and I immediately fell in love. I found myself coding and building programs in all the freetime I had available. I had this incessant urge to learn more and more, and this endless fire to continue to work to build greater and greater things.</p>
				<p>I probably shouldn't speak in past tense, since that urge within me has not died to this day.</p>
				<p><img src="assets/images/hunter-new-york-city-street-view.jpg" alt="" class="" width="100%" ></p>
				<c>CUNY Hunter College of NYC</c>
				<h3>My Educational Career</h3>
				<p>At the moment, I'm a computer science major at Hunter College. It was about halfway through high school did I realize that computer science wasn't something I could just do for myself, to build things just for myself, but I could build things for people. I could help build the future. After moving on from AP Computer Science, and after investing many summers and winters in coding-related intensives and extracirriculars, I chose my major for the reason that I'd be able to continue doing computer science far into the future.</p>
				<p>Although for many years I've pursued knowledge and education in programming, and now computer theory, I still don't have proper experience in the field. I'm hunting for opportunities and internships every day!</p>
				<h3>My Personal Career</h3>
				<p>What I mean by this, is my experience learning for myself, outside of coursework. I've gained experience with:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>AllStarCode, Goldman Sachs</li>
					<li>Yleana Leadership Foundation, Colgate University</li>
					<li>Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics, Bard College</li>
					<li>America on Tech, Tech Flex Leaders</li>
					<li>Robotics Club, Forest Hills High School</li>
					<li>Leadership Development Intern, RippleMatch</li>
				</ul>
				<p>On top of that, I've worked on my own personal projects over the years, including this very website!</p>
				<p>On the home page, you can see a glimpse into the topics that I like to teach myself about. Such as crypotography, machine learning, and anything involving mathematics and graphics! I've never been able to really quench my thirst for knowledge, and so you can always be assured that at any time I'm up to something, and creating things. Feel free to contact me if you see anything on this website that you would like to learn more about!</p>

					<p>I'm currently in my sophomore year of college, and I'm ready to enter the field of computer science on the professional level. I've done as much as I can in terms of summer intensives and extracurriculars, but nothing actually hands-on just yet.</p>
					<p>I'm confident I have the experience and the skills to succeed in an internship working alongside professionals. At any point just send me an email if you'd like to contact me! I would be honored if I've piqued your curiosity.</p>
